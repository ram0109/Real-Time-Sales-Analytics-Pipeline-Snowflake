# ðŸ§  Real-Time Sales Analytics Pipeline | Snowflake, Python, Power BI

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a real-time data analytics pipeline for monitoring and analyzing sales, revenue, and inventory performance. It integrates Python-based data simulators with Snowflake for data ingestion, transformation, and storage, and uses Power BI for dynamic, real-time visualization.

ðŸ”§ Key Features

Automated Data Ingestion: Configured Snowpipe, Streams, and Tasks to enable continuous ingestion and transformation of both structured and semi-structured data.

Data Modeling: Built a star schema model with clustering keys and materialized views to enhance query performance and analytical efficiency.

Real-Time Visualization: Developed live Power BI dashboards with 1-minute refresh intervals to deliver up-to-date KPIs for sales, revenue, and inventory.

Data Security & Governance: Implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), data masking, object tagging, and secure data sharing via Snowflake reader accounts for client-facing access.

Scalability & Optimization: Designed the pipeline to handle large data volumes efficiently, ensuring scalability, reliability, and minimal latency.
